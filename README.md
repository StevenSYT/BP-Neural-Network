## Neural-Network
The input parameters to the neural net
are as follows:
- input dataset – complete path of the post-processed input dataset
- training percent – percentage of the dataset to be used for training
- maximum_iterations – Maximum number of iterations that your algorithm will run. This
parameter is used so that your program terminates in a reasonable time.
- number of hidden layers
- number of neurons in each hidden layer

for example **ds1 80 200 2 4 2** 
The above would imply that the dataset is ds1, the percent of the dataset to be used for
training is 80%, the maximum number of iterations is 200, and there are 2 hidden layers with
(4, 2) neurons. Your program would have to initialize the weights randomly
